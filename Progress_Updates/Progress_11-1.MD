# Progress of the Past Week
Last week we concluded and reflected on the first sprint.  

We shared insights, voted on which ones we considered most important, and developed an action plan for the next sprint.

## Selected insights
We grouped the insights into three categories, _Worked Well, Didn't Work Well,_ and _Do Differently_
### Worked Well
* Team Communication
* Product Backlog Tracking
* Use of Version Control
* Using Android Studio
* Doing Research Into Mobile App Development
### Didn't Work Well
* Applying TDD
* Following Role Assignments
* Hectic Project Schedule
* Getting Android Emulator to Run
### Do Differently
* Expand Automated Testing
* Make Daily Scrum Less Rigid
* Eliminate TDD Slip Ups

We voted on which of these insights we each valued the most; we used these results to develop the following set of actionable items for the next sprint:

## Action Plan
We believe that our daily scrums have become very rigid in that we are essentially just answering the three questions required. Instead, we want to have a more open discussion about progress on the project in addition to answering the three questions.

We want to automate tests and facilitate continuous integration via CircleCI. The first steps have already been taken, but we need to work on getting out JUnit tests working in CircleCI.

Though it has already served us well, we will continue to emphasize the importance of version control to the design and development process. New branches will use Jira naming conventions and be merged into main for each feature, like we’ve been doing.

Likewise, we will continue frequent communications through Jira, GitHub and Discord on all aspects of the project to ensure everyone’s on the same page. Hopefully, expanding our scrum meetings can work towards this as well.

Make sure we are vigilant in writing the automated tests for all classes for which we can write automated tests before the code to ensure correct TDD application, even if we go through just one iteration.
