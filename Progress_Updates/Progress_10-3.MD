  Throughout the week, the group and I have been working hard on the project presentation coming for us on Tuesday and the System Models Assignment due Wednesday. 
  
  Below is a list of some of the work we've done.  
  
# Work Done This Week
  ##   Researching Emissions Database
  Rahul and I have been looking into an emissions database. We've found a promising source in the EPA (available at https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml), but it will require us to find a means of putting this data into the application.
  ##   Work on System Context Model
  We have also been working on the System Context Model, which is almost finished.
  ##   Work on Presentation
  Each team member has been working on the first presentation. It is almost ready and a version of it will be available here on GitHub.
  ##   Research into UX Library
  ##   Research into Testing Framework
