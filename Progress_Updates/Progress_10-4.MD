# October 4th  
Christopher has finished the Use Case Narratives today, and the team will review them tonight. Further, we have chosen a csv from fueleconomy.gov for our source of emissions data.
We are going to meet tonight to rehearse the presentation, revise the script if we need to, and make a review of our System Models work.
