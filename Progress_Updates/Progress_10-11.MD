# Progress of the Past Week
Given that we had done our presentation, this group was left in waiting for the first sprint.

Over that time, we made some decisions and had to make some changes to our approach for this application's development cycle.

## Reduced Product Backlog
First, one of our team member's has decided to drop the course, so we are now a group of just three developers rather than four. The team met on Monday the 11th and devised
a new sprint schedule that, out of necesity, reduced our velocity and eliminated some features from the application. The removed features are listed below:

## Features Removed
* Maps API
* Driving Suggestions
* Automatic Digital Odometer

## UX Library Chosen
In more positive news, we have taken a look at the default UX elements available through Android Studio, and the team has decided to work with these rather than installing
and configuring a new library.
