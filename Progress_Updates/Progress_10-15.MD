# Progress Update 10-15
Here is an update about the team's progress.

## Research and Development
Christopher looked into how to work with Android Studio and is now prepared to begin working on the project, using TDD. 

## Plans
Shortly after this update was committed to the branch, Christopher worked on the "Hypothetical Buyable Fuel" user story and committed the results. Finally, Christopher made a pull request for his work this evening

## Returning to Java
It may have been stated earlier that we were going to be working with Kotlin even though we had originally said that Java would be used for the project. This decision has been reversed thanks to the fact that we are going to be using Android Studio's layout editor for our work. There is simply no need to learn a new language anymore.
